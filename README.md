Update: early wii shopping channel/virtual console code has officially been found in a gigaleak w/ ique.7z code, i guess it was early testing for the (at the time called revolution)
<br>
This matches up perfectly with the beta wii, as it only had virtual console and the early wii shop channel, only had virtual console titles!

<h3>weird thing is, the photos are dated "August 18, 2006" and the code in the nintendo-code-archive branch is dated Dec 9th, 2005, yet they both have the same title images and same page design, i guess nintendo took the if it works it works to the next level..? </h3>
