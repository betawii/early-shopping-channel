# Archive of the early wii shopping channel/ virtual console channel photos!
<br>
This matches up perfectly with the beta wii, as it only had virtual console and the early wii shop channel, only had virtual console titles!

<h3>weird thing is, the photos here are dated "August 18, 2006" and the code above is dated May 5th, 2006, yet they both have the same title images (with a few missing, but they prob added those later in the year) and same page design, i guess nintendo took the if it works it works to the next level..? </h3>
