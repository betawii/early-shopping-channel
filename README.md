<br>
<a herf="https://github.com/betawii/early-shopping-channel/tree/main">https://github.com/betawii/early-shopping-channel/tree/main</a>
<br>
<h3>weird thing is, the photos are dated "August 18, 2006" and the code here is dated Dec 9th, 2005, yet they both have the same title images and same page design, i guess nintendo took the if it works it works to the next level..? </h3>

<a href="https://github.com/betawii/early-shopping-channel/tree/early-shopping-channel-remade">Check out the remade html of the 2005/aug 2006 shop by me, using nintendos images and js from the 2005 shop, but with a new frontend thats not as heavy on jsp (easier to view) :)</a>

OSS folder dated dec 9th 2005 (12/9/2005), it seems to be for the scrapped virtual console channel/ early shop channel, <br> basically you would go to a home menu with these options:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e9fd939-694b-4c5d-8734-348e6ba972d4"><br>

and some of those options lead you to the "early wii shop screenshots" seen here:<Br>

<br><br>
<p>digging through teh oss will give you more info, it is JSP (JavaScript Server Pages) idk how to use those so i just put them here, hopefully someone can get the 2005 code to work with a website or smth but rn idk how 2 deal with the code :/</p>
<br><br>
here are some screenshots of it on localhost btw (kinda broken cuz i tried to convert it to plain html ü¶Ü:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0a609d4-e765-4e4f-b3d6-cb7e3d825f7b"><br>
<p>(notice that blue button, in the code it says RENT, meaning you could at one point rent titles!)</p>
<Br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb39767-58b4-4936-8bd5-4e31806fc19e"><br>
<p>(a title description page with placeholder text [sadly the under button hover and some stuff are lost :<)</p>
<Br><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09d49aca-57d3-4569-9611-4aebdb191d5d"><br>
<p>(a catalog, empty sadly, BUTTTTT, the title images exist in the <b>/oss/oss/WebContent/common/titles/</b> folder ü´¢</p>
<Br><br>
<p>one final intresting thing to note (i havent fully dug through the code yet) <br>
is that in <b>in /oss/oss/WebContent/en_US/txt/license.txt</b>, it reads <br> 
<b>
  "Nintendo <b>Revolution</b> Virtual Console"
<br>
"Usage Terms and Privacy Statement"
</b>
  <br>
  Proving that these files are older then the final "Wii" name, yet they stuck with this design and htmls until <b>August 2006!</b> meaning that somehow they managed to <b>COMPLETELY</b> change the design and html structure <b>in only 3 MONTHS?!</b> those devs must of been working over time üò≠
